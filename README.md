This is a project made in JAVA using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) in order to interconnect a group of computers under the same network and have a chat group where each user
(every cpu is an user) can send each other private messages and group messages, as we do in our daily life with WhatsApp.
I implemented the concept of server-client, when a client send a message no matter if it is private or public, the server will receive the message from the
sender and depending on what the sender selects, the server will send the message to the receiver once it is procesed wether it is public or private the message.
